Russian Math BYOM (Build Your Own Math) program is a structured program offered by [Russian Math Tutors Home Page](https://russianmathtutors.com).

** Key Principles

* Problem-Focused Learning: The core of the BYOM program is challenging students with engaging problems. Instead of rote memorization or formulaic learning, students grapple with problems first, developing their own strategies and understanding in the process.
Emphasis on Exploration and Discovery: Students are encouraged to think independently, experiment with solutions, and learn through discovery. Teachers act as facilitators, providing guidance and hints but encouraging students to derive mathematical concepts and patterns themselves.
Conceptual Understanding: The BYOM program aims for students to develop a deep understanding of why mathematical principles work, rather than just how to mechanically apply them. This fosters adaptable problem-solving and flexibility when tackling new problems.
Lifelong Skills: BYOM seeks to instill critical thinking, problem-solving, perseverance, logical reasoning, and an overall love of learning ‚Äì these apply far beyond just the world of mathematics.

** Methodology

* Workbooks (Likely Based on Peterson): RMT's BYOM program seems to be influenced by the work of Lyudmilla Peterson. They offer grade-specific workbooks, likely translations or adaptations of her original textbooks, providing structured guidance within an exploratory learning framework.
Individualized Tutoring: RMT tutors likely leverage these workbooks as a resource, tailoring instruction to each student. They focus on areas where students need support, adjust the pace, and supplement with additional problems or challenges when needed.
Collaboration and Discussion: While independent problem-solving is key, the BYOM approach can also involve group work and discussions where students share their approaches, learn from peers, and defend their solutions.
Outcomes

* Strong Mathematical Foundations: Students develop a solid grasp of core mathematical concepts across various strands like algebra, geometry, and arithmetic.
Success in Math Competitions: The BYOM approach prepares students well for math competitions like Math Kangaroo, AMC, AIME, and others due to its focus on problem-solving.
Overall Success: Students who learn through the BYOM program are equipped with valuable skills that can translate to success in other academic areas, standardized tests, and life in general.
Important Considerations

* Ideal for all students: RMT claims that the BYOM program is suitable for all students, regardless of their initial skill level.
Commitment: BYOM likely requires commitment and effort as problems can be challenging and demand students think outside the box.
Finding the right tutor: Success may heavily depend on finding a skilled Russian Math Tutor who understands the BYOM methodology and can connect effectively with the student.
